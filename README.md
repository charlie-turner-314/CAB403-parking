## libs

&rarr; for things like hash table implementations etc.

## src

&rarr; for the three main programs

- Manager
- Simulator
- Fire Alarm

## Makefiles

root makefile calls makefiles for each other directory, prolly needs to be in a
specific order so everything is all good.
Kinda like the maven thing for java
