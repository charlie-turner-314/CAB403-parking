## Running anything

The Makefile should be set up so that any C files in `src` are compiled individually on `make` or `make main`,
and tests are compiled on `make test`. If running on linux need to uncomment `LDFLAGS` in the makefile to make, should be labelled in there.

## libs

&rarr; For any utility functions to be included in the programs

## src

&rarr; For the main programs

- Manager
- Simulator
- Fire Alarm

## test

&rarr; Testing. Hashtable_test.c contains a pretty good (imo) main function to copy for testing
